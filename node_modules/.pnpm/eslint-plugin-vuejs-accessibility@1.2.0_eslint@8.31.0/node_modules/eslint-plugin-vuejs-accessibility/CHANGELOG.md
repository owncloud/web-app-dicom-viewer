### Added

- `labelComponents` options to add custom label components in `form-control-has-label`

## [1.1.1] - 2021-12-23

- Fix the `anchor-has-content` handling for content directives (v-html, v-text) on child elements.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-10-14

### Added

- Change the peer dependency to allow ESLint 8 without a warning.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-10-14

### Changed

- Major bump because of the `aria-query` dependency major bump.

## [0.7.1] - 2021-07-15

### Changed

- Reduce overall bundle size by ignoring a lot more files in `.npmignore`.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-07-15

### Added

- The `accessibleDirectives` option to both `heading-has-content` and `anchor-has-content`.

### Changed

- Ensure directives that have identifiers for values are counted as present in the element.
- Convert over to using TypeScript for development.

## [0.6.2] - 2021-05-26

### Changed

- Fix `iframe-has-title` such that if the attribute is ommitted completely that it fires correctly.
- Fix `form-control-has-label` to ignore form controls nested inside `aria-hidden` elements.

## [0.6.1] - 2021-01-21

### Changed

- Fix up the extra quote at the end of the doc links.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-10-29

### Added

- For the `heading-has-content` and the `anchor-has-content` rules, add an `accessibleChildren` option that always marks certain children as being accessible.

### Changed

- Handle non string literal role values and `role-has-required-aria-props` and non string literal value for `kind` attribute in `media-has-caption`.

## [0.5.1] - 2020-09-08

### Changed

- When you pass a conditional expression into an `:is`, then `getElementType` would not be able to handle it. It doesn't truly handle it now, as it just ends up returning `null` for the value of the `:is` expression, but at least now it doesn't break.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-09-05

### Changed

- Ensure all rules that allow configuring extra components that should match certain conditions support both forms of casing (`VFoo` and `v-foo`).
- For the `anchor-has-content` rule, we're now going to allow images with an `alt` tag as the screen reader should pick that up as the content.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-08-15

### Added

- The `controlComponents` option for the `label-has-for` rule, which allows you to configure the rule to allow additional control components.

## [0.3.1] - 2020-07-10

### Changed

- When emojis are hidden from the a11y tree, don't warn with the `accessible-emoji` rule.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-07-03

### Changed

- For the `anchor-has-content` rule, allow anchors with explicit aria labels to pass.
- For the `label-has-for` rule when validating that there is correct nesting, ensure that we're actually checking for form controls and not just checking for VElement nodes.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-06-26

### Changed

- Bump the dependency on `aria-query` to `4.2.2`.

## [0.1.3] - 2020-05-27

### Changed

- Support deeply nested `input` controls for the `form-control-has-label` rule.
